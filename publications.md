**IEEE Sensors Journal, 2020**. \\
Impedance control is often preferred in teleoperated robots due to its capability to modulate the dynamic relationship between  the position and force of the robot. A methodology for quantitatively determining the desired dynamic parameters of the robot, in order to have stable interaction with the environment, is proposed in this paper.

*This paper presents a unique unmanned ground vehicle with a dynamic wheelbase and an adaptive thrust based friction optimization scheme that aids in the traversal of steep slopes and slippery surfaces. The vehicle is capable of adapting itself to the surface topography using an impedance-based stabilization module*.

*Impedance controllers which modulate the dynamic relationship between position and force are advantageous. Yet, impedance control has always been plagued by the challenge of determining the degree to which the dynamics need to be modified. The issue  of quantitatively determining the desired parameters is addressed in this paper.*

*Human-robot interaction is prominently seen in industries, haptics etc. where the underlying objective is to make the robot assistive in nature to the human. A methodology is proposed herein to improve the assistive nature of the robot by reducing the inertia felt by the human. An impedance controller is presented to modulate the dynamics of the manipulator and assign an apparent inertia to the robot.*
