| [![uw_dynamics](assets/img/uw_dynamics.gif)](https://github.com/imsenthur/uw_dynamics){:target="blank"} **uw_dynamics**:  Unlike underwater vehicles such as ROVs and AUVs, these robots are propelled by fluid-structure interaction which are relatively hard to simulate compared to thrusters/propellers (as found in ROVs and AUVs). The proposed project aims at developing a gazebo package containing plugins capable of simulating such robots. It can also be extended to simulate biomimetic robots in fluids of various densities and even aerial biomimetic robots.
