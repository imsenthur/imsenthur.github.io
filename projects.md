![Anton](assets/img/GEL.gif) **Anton: an open-source generative design framework built on Blender, the open-source 3D creation suite**. At its current stage of development, anton uses a narrow-band topology optimization methodology as a design generator and uses implicit surfaces for mesh generation.\\

![Ibex](assets/img/ibex.gif) **Ibex: a unique unmanned ground vehicle with a dynamic wheelbase and an adaptive thrust based friction optimization scheme** that aids in the traversal of steep slopes and slippery surfaces. The vehicle is capable of adapting itself to the surface topography using an impedance-based stabilization module to minimize the mechanical oscillatory transients induced during its motion.\\

![AIR](assets/img/air.gif) **Dynamic Modulation of Human Interactive Robots using Impedance Control**: Human-robot interaction is prominently seen in industries, haptics etc. where the underlying objective is to make the robot assistive in nature to the human. A methodology is proposed herein to improve the assistive nature of the robot by reducing the inertia felt by the human. An impedance controller is presented to modulate the dynamics of the manipulator and assign an apparent inertia to the robot.\\
